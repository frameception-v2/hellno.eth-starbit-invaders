### Implementation Rationale  
1. **Template-first setup** (Task 1) ensures foundational state management.  
2. **Early visible features** (Tasks 2-6) prioritize player movement, invaders, and shooting for immediate gameplay.  
3. **Dependencies mapped** (e.g., invaders require state initialization) prevent blocked workflows.  
4. **Security deferred** (Task 11) until core mechanics are functional balances speed and safety.  
5. **UI polish** (Tasks 7,10) added after core loop to refine user experience.
